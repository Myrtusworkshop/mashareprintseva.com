Tailoring has always been very special to me.

I feel that the process of creating clothes fascinating, especially when emphasises the shapes and features the values of its owner. Modelling and construction garments to speak about individuality and style, and, at the same time hiding some flaws under a perfectly tailored suit, is a fascinating puzzle for me.

For the same reason i give my preference to embroidery as a means of clothes decoration, because a single stitch can be tremendously eloquent, making the look unique, no matter where it is placed - on a well-tailored suit or a strict button-down dress.

Embroidery is an expression of an exquisite taste and style.
